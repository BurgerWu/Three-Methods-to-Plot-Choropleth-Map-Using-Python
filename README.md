# Three-Methods-to-Plot-Choropleth-Map-Using-Python

## Introduction
Choropleth map is an extremely effective way to exhibit geospatial information, usually uses color to express the intensity of that information. In this notebook, we are going to show you three Python libraries that can help you make beautiful Choropleth map, including Folium, Plotly and Geopandas.

## About Dataset
This dataset is retrieved from <a href='https://www.ris.gov.tw/app/portal/346'>ministry of interior of Taiwan</a>. This dataset contains population data versus administrative division of Taiwan. In this project, we are going to visualize the data with Choropleth map.

## Library Used
- Pandas
- json
- Folium
- Plotly
- Geopandas
- matplotlib

## Files and Folders
- Populations.csv (Dataset of population data in Taiwan)
- Three Methods to Plot Choropleth Map Using Python.ipynb (Main notebook)
- Three Methods to Plot Choropleth Map Using Python.html (HTML of main notebook)

## Summary
We are now able to ceate three great Choropleth map using three different libraries. Each of them has their own advantges. Folium and Plotly can make professional and interactive maps while those maps are memory-consuming. Geopandas can help you build a Choropleth quickly and conveniently.
